# All Fixes Summary - October 14, 2025

## Overview
Fixed 5 critical bugs in the MSH Image Optimizer plugin and added new UI functionality for editing already-applied filenames.

---

## Bug Fixes

### 1. Recursive Filename Duplication ✅
**File:** `class-msh-image-optimizer.php:2188-2190`

**Problem:** Filenames growing exponentially with each rename:
- `spectacles.gif` → `spectacles-clearing-spectacles-minneapolis-clearing-spectacles-minneapolis-clearing-spectacles-clearing-spectacles-minneapolis-minneapolis.gif`

**Root Cause:** The `collect_visual_keywords()` function was using the current filename as a source for building new filename suggestions, creating a feedback loop.

**Fix:** Removed `file_basename` from keyword sources. Suggestions now based ONLY on:
- Attachment title (metadata)
- Page title (context)
- Tags
- Category/Context data

**Result:** Clean, non-recursive filenames with proper deduplication.

---

### 2. Wrong "rehabilitation" Descriptor for Equipment ✅
**File:** `class-msh-image-optimizer.php:1066-1077`

**Problem:** Images categorized as "Product / Equipment" getting hardcoded "rehabilitation-equipment" instead of using actual metadata descriptor.

Example:
- Title: "Antique Farm Machinery"
- Suggestion: `rehabilitation-equipment-minneapolis-mn-762.jpg` ❌
- Expected: `operational-equipment-minneapolis-mn-762.jpg` ✓

**Fix:** Added descriptor extraction from metadata before falling back to hardcoded default:
```php
// Try to extract descriptor from metadata (title, alt, caption)
$descriptor_details = $this->build_business_descriptor_details($context);
$descriptor_slug = $descriptor_details['slug'];

if (!empty($descriptor_slug) && $descriptor_slug !== 'brand') {
    $location_suffix = $this->location_slug !== '' ? '-' . $this->location_slug : '';
    return $this->slugify($descriptor_slug . '-equipment' . $location_suffix);
}
```

**Result:** Equipment filenames now use actual metadata descriptors.

---

### 3. Stale Suggestions Not Regenerating After Context Refresh ✅
**File:** `class-msh-image-optimizer.php:3966-3970`

**Problem:** When context was refreshed, old filename suggestions persisted because the analyzer only invalidated suggestions when the context hash was **present** and different. Missing hashes were treated as "no change needed."

**Fix:** Changed logic to treat missing context hash as a mismatch:
```php
// OLD (BUGGY):
if (!empty($suggested_filename) && !empty($suggested_context_hash) && $suggested_context_hash !== $current_context_signature) {

// NEW (FIXED):
if (!empty($suggested_filename) && (empty($suggested_context_hash) || $suggested_context_hash !== $current_context_signature)) {
```

**Result:** All suggestions regenerate when context changes, even for old attachments without hashes.

---

### 4. Stale Suggestions Left Behind During Context Refresh ✅
**File:** `class-msh-image-optimizer.php:3220`

**Problem:** The `flag_attachment_for_reoptimization()` function cleared the context hash but left the old `_msh_suggested_filename` in place, causing stale UI state.

**Fix:** Added deletion of the suggestion when clearing context hash:
```php
delete_post_meta($attachment_id, '_msh_suggested_filename_context');
delete_post_meta($attachment_id, '_msh_suggested_filename'); // Clear stale suggestion
update_post_meta($attachment_id, 'msh_context_needs_refresh', '1');
```

**Result:** No stale suggestions survive context refresh.

---

### 5. Analyzer Cache Preventing Fresh Analysis ⚠️
**Issue:** After deleting optimization status to force re-analysis, analyzer still showed "All images are optimized!" due to 30-minute cache.

**Solution Provided:** Cleared transients via WP-CLI:
```bash
wp transient delete --all
```

**Note:** This was a testing workflow issue, not a code bug. User can also use Shift+Click on Analyze button to force refresh.

## New Feature: Edit Already-Applied Filenames ✅

### Problem Statement
Once a filename has been applied (renamed), there was no UI to edit it again. Users had to:
1. Manually create a new suggestion
2. Or use external tools

### Solution Implemented
Added inline editing capability for current filenames with:
- Edit button (pen icon) next to every filename
- Inline input field on click
- Save/Cancel buttons
- Enter to save, Escape to cancel
- Full rename system integration

### Files Modified:

#### 1. JavaScript UI - `image-optimizer-modern.js`

**Added Edit Button:** (Line 1869-1874)
```javascript
<div class="current-filename-display">
    <strong class="filename-heading">${filename}</strong>
    <button class="button button-link edit-current-filename" data-id="${image.ID}" title="Edit filename">
        <span class="dashicons dashicons-edit"></span>
    </button>
</div>
```

**Added Event Handler:** (Line 1583-1588)
```javascript
// Edit current filename button
$(document).on('click', '.edit-current-filename', function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    const attachmentId = $(this).data('id');
    UI.showCurrentFilenameEditor(attachmentId);
});
```

**Added Three Methods:** (Lines 2376-2477)
1. `showCurrentFilenameEditor(attachmentId)` - Shows inline editor
2. `saveCurrentFilename(attachmentId, originalFilename)` - Saves via AJAX
3. `cancelCurrentFilenameEdit(attachmentId, originalFilename)` - Cancels edit

### How It Works:

1. **User clicks edit button (pen icon)**
2. Filename display is replaced with:
   - Text input (pre-filled with current filename)
   - Save button
   - Cancel button
3. **User edits and clicks Save (or presses Enter)**
4. System saves new filename as suggestion via `msh_save_filename_suggestion`
5. System applies it via `msh_apply_filename_suggestions` batch endpoint (with single image)
6. Safe Rename system executes with full verification
7. UI updates to show new filename
8. AppState updated with new file_path

### Features:
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts (Enter=Save, Escape=Cancel)
- ✅ Validation (empty filenames blocked)
- ✅ No-op detection (if filename unchanged, just cancels)
- ✅ Error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Full integration with existing rename system
- ✅ Uses WordPress Dashicons for edit icon

---

## Testing Instructions

### Test Bug Fixes:

1. **Clear cache and optimization status:**
```bash
wp transient delete --all
wp db query "DELETE FROM wp_postmeta WHERE meta_key IN ('msh_optimization_status', '_msh_suggested_filename', 'msh_filename_last_suggested', '_msh_suggested_filename_context')"
```

2. **Run Analyzer:**
   - Should find all images needing optimization
   - Should generate fresh suggestions

3. **Check for Recursive Duplication:**
   - Look at attachments 1692 (spectacles), 1628 (triforce), 1045 (unicorn)
   - Expected: Clean suggestions without duplication
   - Example: `spectacles-clearing-minneapolis-1692.gif`

4. **Check Equipment Descriptor:**
   - Look at attachment 762 (farm machinery)
   - Expected: Uses metadata descriptor, not "rehabilitation"
   - Example: `operational-equipment-minneapolis-mn-762.jpg`

5. **Check Duplicate Token Removal:**
   - Look at attachments 967, 1022, 1027, 1025, 1029
   - Expected: No duplicate tokens
   - Example: `580x300-alignment-minneapolis-967.jpg` (not `580x300-580x300`)

### Test New Edit Feature:

1. **Optimize an image** to apply a filename
2. **Look for pen icon** next to the filename
3. **Click pen icon** - should show inline editor
4. **Edit the filename** and press Enter
5. **Verify rename executes** and UI updates
6. **Try clicking edit again** - should work on newly renamed file
