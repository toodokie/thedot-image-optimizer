### Issue #1: Usage Index Not Auto-Refreshed After Rename/Optimize

**Status:** üìù Documented - Will fix in Phase 2
**Priority:** Medium
**Reported:** October 17, 2025

#### Problem Description:

After running optimize operations (which can include renaming files), the usage index is not automatically refreshed. This causes:

1. **Stale data in index** - Old URLs remain in index even though files were renamed
2. **"Action needed" warning persists** - Shows "build usage index before renaming" even after recent rebuild
3. **Manual intervention required** - User must manually click "Rebuild Index" again

#### User Experience Impact:

- **Confusion:** "I just rebuilt the index, why is it asking me again?"
- **Extra steps:** User has to rebuild index after every rename batch
- **Performance:** Full site scan required each time (slow on large sites)

#### Current Behavior:

```
User Flow:
1. Rebuild usage index ‚úÖ
2. Run optimize batch (includes renames) ‚úÖ
3. Files renamed, URLs updated in database ‚úÖ
4. Usage index still has OLD URLs ‚ùå
5. Warning appears: "Action needed - build usage index" ‚ùå
6. User must manually rebuild again ‚ùå
```

#### Expected Behavior:

```
User Flow:
1. Rebuild usage index ‚úÖ
2. Run optimize batch (includes renames) ‚úÖ
3. Files renamed, URLs updated in database ‚úÖ
4. Index automatically refreshed in background ‚úÖ
5. No warning shown (or "Refreshing..." indicator) ‚úÖ
6. User continues working ‚úÖ
```

#### Technical Analysis:

**Files Involved:**
- `includes/class-msh-image-optimizer.php` - Optimize batch handler
- `includes/class-msh-safe-rename-system.php` - Rename operations
- `includes/class-msh-image-usage-index.php` - Index management
- `includes/class-msh-usage-index-background.php` - Background jobs

**Current Code Gaps:**
```php
// In ajax_optimize_batch() - Line ~7300
// After batch completes:
update_option('msh_last_optimization_run', current_time('mysql'));
wp_send_json_success(['results' => $results]);

// ‚ùå Missing: Index refresh trigger
// ‚ùå Missing: Queue background job
```

#### Proposed Solutions:

**Option A: Full Auto-Rebuild (Heavy)**
- Trigger full index rebuild after each batch
- ‚ùå Slow (scans entire site)
- ‚ùå Blocks user workflow
- Not recommended

**Option B: Background Queue Refresh (Better)**
- Queue background job to rebuild index
- ‚úÖ Non-blocking
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Still scans entire site (wasteful)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slight delay before accuracy

**Option C: Incremental Update (Best) ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED**
- Track which attachments were renamed
- Only refresh those specific entries in index
- ‚úÖ Fast (only changed items)
- ‚úÖ Immediate update
- ‚úÖ Efficient (minimal queries)
- Requires new method: `refresh_single_attachment($id)`

**Option D: Smarter Warning Message (Quick Fix)**
- Change message from "Action needed" to "Refresh recommended"
- ‚úÖ Less alarming
- ‚úÖ Quick to implement
- ‚ùå Doesn't fix root cause

**Option E: Hybrid Approach**
- Phase 1: Background queue + softer messaging
- Phase 2: Incremental updates for efficiency

#### Recommended Implementation (Phase 2):

**Step 1: Track Changed Attachments**
```php
// In optimize_single_image()
if ($rename_feedback['status'] === 'success') {
    $changed_attachment_ids[] = $attachment_id;
}
```

**Step 2: Incremental Index Refresh**
```php
// After batch completes
if (!empty($changed_attachment_ids)) {
    $usage_index = MSH_Image_Usage_Index::get_instance();
    foreach ($changed_attachment_ids as $id) {
        $usage_index->refresh_single_attachment($id);
    }
}
```

**Step 3: Add New Method to Usage Index**
```php
// In class-msh-image-usage-index.php
public function refresh_single_attachment($attachment_id) {
    // 1. Get current file path
    // 2. Find old entries for this attachment
    // 3. Re-scan content for new URL references
    // 4. Update index entries
    // 5. Invalidate stats cache
}
```

**Step 4: Update Warning Logic**
```php
// More intelligent warning
if ($index_stale && !$recently_optimized) {
    return 'Action needed ‚Äì build usage index before renaming';
} elseif ($index_stale && $recently_optimized) {
    return 'Index refresh recommended after recent optimizations';
}
```

#### Effort Estimate:

- **Investigation:** 1 hour (already done)
- **Implementation:** 3-4 hours
  - New `refresh_single_attachment()` method: 2 hours
  - Integration with optimize batch: 1 hour
  - Testing: 1 hour
- **Total:** 4-5 hours

#### Testing Plan:

1. Rebuild usage index (verify counts accurate)
2. Rename 10 files via optimize batch
3. Verify index auto-refreshes (no manual rebuild needed)
4. Check usage counts still accurate
5. Verify performance (should be fast - only 10 items refreshed)
6. Test with large batch (100+ files)

#### Related Enhancements:

- Add "Refreshing index..." progress indicator in UI
- Show "Last refreshed: X minutes ago" timestamp
- Add manual "Refresh Now" button (quick incremental refresh)
- Cache index results per session to reduce queries

#### Workaround (Current):

**For Users:**
1. After running optimize batch
2. Manually click "Rebuild Usage Index" again
3. Wait for full site scan to complete
4. Proceed with next batch

**For Developers:**
```bash
# Via WP-CLI - faster than UI
wp msh rebuild-index
```

## üéØ Future Enhancements

### Enhancement #1: AI Metadata with Profile Location Context

**Status:** üìù Planned for Multilingual AI Phase
**Priority:** Medium

Currently, AI-generated metadata doesn't use the active profile's city/business location in the generated text. For example:

- **Profile:** "Spanish Landing Pages" in Barcelona
- **Expected:** Metadata mentions "Barcelona" or "Espa√±a"
- **Actual:** Generic descriptions without location reference

**Planned:** Thread profile location into AI prompts during multilingual implementation.

**Fix:** Changed `"you're"` to `"you\'re"` in PHP string.

**File:** `admin/image-optimizer-admin.php:276`
