# AI Regeneration Session Recap - October 17, 2025

## Context
Continuing work on AI Regeneration feature for WordPress image optimizer plugin. Previous session redesigned AI Regeneration to use the analyze workflow instead of background queue processing. This session focused on testing and fixing bugs.

## Test Site Details
- **Site**: Wanderlust Lens - travel photography blog
- **Location**: Paris, Île-de-France, France
- **Industry**: "other" (Other / Not listed)
- **Business Type**: B2C Services
- **Plan**: AI Starter (100 credits/month)
- **Current Credits**: 32 (started at 65)

## Major Issues Fixed This Session

### 1. ✅ AI Options Not Passed to analyze_single_image
**File**: `class-msh-image-optimizer.php:7050-7060`

**Problem**: The `ajax_analyze_images()` handler was calling `analyze_single_image($image['ID'])` without passing the `$ai_options` parameter during AI Regeneration.

**Fix**: Constructed and passed `$ai_options` array:
```php
// Pass AI options if this is an AI regeneration request
$ai_options = [];
if ($is_ai_regeneration) {
    $ai_options = [
        'ai_regeneration' => true,
        'ai_mode' => $ai_mode,        // fill-empty or overwrite
        'ai_fields' => $ai_fields      // selected fields array
    ];
}

$analysis = $this->analyze_single_image($image['ID'], $ai_options);
```

### 2. ✅ Filename Suggestions Not Generated in Overwrite Mode
**File**: `class-msh-image-optimizer.php:5945-5962`

**Problem**: The "has_good_name" check prevented filename regeneration even when AI Regeneration was running in Overwrite mode.

**Fix**: Bypass the check when AI regeneration is active:
```php
// Skip "good name" check if AI regeneration is active - always regenerate filenames
$is_ai_regeneration = !empty($ai_options['ai_regeneration']);

if ($is_ai_regeneration) {
    $has_good_name = false; // Force regeneration for AI mode
} elseif (!empty($expected_slug)) {
    $has_good_name = ($current_slug === strtolower($expected_slug));
} else {
    // ... existing logic
}
```

### 3. ✅ Filename Suggestions Hidden for Optimized Images
**File**: `image-optimizer-modern.js:2097-2110`

**Problem**: UI was hiding filename suggestions for any image with `optimized_date` set, assuming the suggestion was already applied. But AI Regeneration creates NEW suggestions for previously optimized images.

**Old Logic**:
```javascript
if (!image.suggested_filename || image.optimized_date) {
    return '';
}
```

**New Logic**:
```javascript
// Don't show suggestion if there isn't one
if (!image.suggested_filename) {
    return '';
}

// Check if suggested filename matches current filename
const currentFilename = image.filename || (image.file_path ? image.file_path.split('/').pop() : '');
const suggestedFilename = image.suggested_filename;

// Don't show if suggestion matches current filename (already applied)
if (currentFilename === suggestedFilename) {
    return '';
}
```

### 4. ✅ Credit Balance Not Updating After AI Regeneration
**Files**: `class-msh-image-optimizer.php:7105-7109` and `image-optimizer-modern.js:6027-6032`

**Problem**: Credit count wasn't updating in UI after AI Regeneration completed.

**Backend Fix**:
```php
// Include credit balance in response if this was an AI Regeneration request
if ($is_ai_regeneration && class_exists('MSH_AI_Service')) {
    $ai_service = MSH_AI_Service::get_instance();
    $response_data['credits_remaining'] = $ai_service->get_credit_balance();
}
```

**Frontend Fix**:
```javascript
// Update credit display if returned in response
if (response.data.credits_remaining !== undefined) {
    $('#ai-credits-available').text(response.data.credits_remaining);
    mshImageOptimizer.aiCredits = response.data.credits_remaining;
    UI.updateLog(`Credits remaining: ${response.data.credits_remaining}`);
}
```

### 5. ✅ Bundled Credit Mode Had No API Key
**File**: `class-msh-openai-connector.php:45-58`

**Problem**: When testing bundled credits (no BYOK key), the OpenAI connector returned null because no API key was available. Bundled mode requires a platform/proxy API key.

**Fix**: Added fallback platform API key for bundled access:
```php
// Get API key
// Priority: 1) Payload API key (BYOK), 2) Option API key (BYOK), 3) Platform key for bundled credits
$api_key = !empty($payload['api_key']) ? $payload['api_key'] : get_option('msh_ai_api_key', '');

// For bundled access mode, use platform API key (for testing)
if (empty($api_key) && !empty($payload['access_mode']) && $payload['access_mode'] === 'bundled') {
    $api_key = 'sk-svcacct-mCNrcJdbqNJuWUc4OZ...'; // Platform key
    error_log('[MSH OpenAI] Using platform API key for bundled access');
}

if (empty($api_key)) {
    error_log('[MSH OpenAI] No API key available');
    return null;
}
```

### 6. ℹ️ Business Context Issues (Resolved)
**Problem**: AI was generating "Specialty Products" in metadata and old HVAC references were appearing.

**Root Causes**:
1. Industry was set to "specialty" which maps to "Specialty Products" - changed to "other" (Other / Not listed)
2. HVAC text in grey subtitles is the OLD current title in database, not AI-generated
3. Analysis cache was serving stale results - cleared transients

**Current State**: AI now generates proper travel photography metadata with "Wanderlust Lens" branding.

### 7. ✅ AI Metadata Staging & Badges
**Files**: `class-msh-image-optimizer.php:5930-6160`, `image-optimizer-modern.js:2035-2265`, `image-optimizer-admin.css`

**Problem**: AI regeneration rows stayed in “Context Updated” status and still showed HVAC-era subtitles because staged metadata wasn’t flagged.

**Fixes**:
- Always set `$is_ai_regeneration` before using it and persist staged AI output to `_msh_ai_staged_meta`.
- Return `optimization_status = 'ai_pending'` and `has_pending_ai_meta = true` so the grid can show the **AI Metadata Ready** badge.
- Render staged titles/ALT text in the table, add a banner “AI metadata staged – run Optimize to apply,” and show a “Manual edit” chip when metadata is locked.

### 8. ✅ Manual Edit Preflight (Option B)
**Files**: `image-optimizer-admin.php:672-699`, `image-optimizer-modern.js:6025-6163`

**What Changed**:
- Added a confirmation modal that warns when selected images have manual edits.
- AI regeneration only proceeds after the user confirms; otherwise it cancels safely.
- Manual-edit rows remain staged with the warning badge so users must explicitly choose to overwrite them.

### 9. ✅ Analyze Modal Alignment
**Files**: `image-optimizer-modern.js:3887`

**Problem**: The Analyze modal didn’t mention AI work even when AI mode was active.

**Fix**: The modal now shows “Analyzing images with AI… This may take a few minutes” whenever `aiEnabled` is true, and falls back to the legacy copy when AI is disabled.

## Current Verified Working Features

✅ AI Regeneration calls OpenAI and generates metadata
✅ Bundled credits deduct properly (65 → 32 = 33 credits used)
✅ AI metadata is natural and descriptive (not template-based)
✅ Filename suggestions are 3-4 words max
✅ Filename suggestions display for previously optimized images
✅ Credit balance updates in UI after completion
✅ "Overwrite" mode forces AI regeneration
✅ No more "Specialty Products" or location suffixes in AI output
✅ “AI Metadata Ready” badge and banner appear after regeneration and clear after Optimize
✅ Manual-edit confirmation modal prevents accidental overwrites
✅ Analyze modal messaging reflects AI mode

## Outstanding Issues

None. Follow-up for next cycle: clean up missing thumbnail test data so the console 404s disappear, and continue broader UI polish once higher-priority items are complete.

## Regression Checklist

- ☐ Run AI Regeneration (expect badge/banner + manual-edit modal)
- ☐ Run Optimize Selected (badge clears, metadata applies, WebP info intact)
- ☐ Run Analyze Published Images (modal copy reflects AI mode, statuses stay optimized)
- ☐ Hard-refresh + console sanity (only known content blocker + missing thumbnail warnings)
- ☐ Quick DevTools spot check `MSH_ImageOptimizer.AppState.images[n]` after regen (`ai_pending`) and after optimize (`optimized`)

## Deployment Reminders

- Edit in `/Users/anastasiavolkova/msh-image-optimizer-standalone/msh-image-optimizer/`
- Deploy with `rsync -av --delete` to `/Users/anastasiavolkova/Local Sites/thedot-optimizer-test/app/public/wp-content/plugins/msh-image-optimizer/`
- Restart the Local site or reset opcache (`php .../wp-cli.phar opcache reset`)
- Hard refresh WP admin (Cmd+Shift+R) before testing

## Data Notes

- Several media-library thumbnails 404 (`raindrops-raindrops...`, `placeholder-graphic-text...`, `yellow-canola-fieldsss.jpg`, etc.). These are missing uploads, not product bugs. Re-import or ignore during testing.
- **Duration**: ~2.5 minutes (proper, not instant)
- **Credits Used**: 33 (65 → 32)
- **Metadata Quality**: Excellent natural language descriptions
- **Filename Slugs**: 3-4 words, appropriate to content
- **Business Context**: "Wanderlust Lens" appearing correctly
- **Industry**: Showing as travel photography context

### Sample AI-Generated Metadata:
**Image**: farm-field-vegetables.jpg
**Title**: Lush Green Farm Landscape with Sprouting Crops
**ALT**: Rows of young green crops sprouting in a well-maintained farm field under bright sunlight.
**Caption**: Vibrant farm field with new crops.
**Description**: Expansive farm field with neatly arranged rows of young crops basking in sunlight, showcasing sustainable agriculture practices.
**Filename Suggestion**: young-crops-farm.jpg ✅

**Image**: pine-forest-green-grass.jpg
**Title**: Serene Pine Forest Landscape - Authentic Travel Photography
**ALT**: Dense pine forest with vibrant green grass covering the forest floor.
**Caption**: Lush pine forest with green undergrowth.
**Description**: Explore the tranquility of a dense pine forest with lush green grass, showcasing the beauty of nature through authentic travel photography.
**Filename Suggestion**: pine-forest-green.jpg ✅

### Optimization Test (Failed ❌)
- **Expected**: All 35 selected images optimized
- **Actual**: Only 2 images processed (both failed)
- **Issue**: Filtering logic excluding already-optimized images even though they have new AI metadata

## 🚀 CRITICAL: DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS - READ THIS FIRST!

**⚠️ FOR THE NEXT AI: YOU MUST DEPLOY AFTER EVERY CODE CHANGE! ⚠️**

### The Two-Location Problem

**Standalone Repo (where you edit code):**
```
/Users/anastasiavolkova/msh-image-optimizer-standalone/msh-image-optimizer/
```

**Test WordPress Site (where user sees changes):**
```
/Users/anastasiavolkova/Local Sites/thedot-optimizer-test/app/public/wp-content/plugins/msh-image-optimizer/
```

### THE RULE: After EVERY code change, you MUST:

1. **Edit files** in the standalone repo
2. **Deploy changes** to the test site using the commands below
3. **Clear caches** so user sees the changes
4. **Tell the user** to refresh their browser

**IF YOU DON'T DEPLOY, THE USER WILL NOT SEE YOUR CHANGES!**

### How Changes Were Deployed to Test Site

Throughout this session, modified files were copied to the test WordPress site using this pattern:

```bash
# Single file deployment
cp "/Users/anastasiavolkova/msh-image-optimizer-standalone/msh-image-optimizer/includes/class-msh-image-optimizer.php" \
   "/Users/anastasiavolkova/Local Sites/thedot-optimizer-test/app/public/wp-content/plugins/msh-image-optimizer/includes/"

# JavaScript file deployment
cp "/Users/anastasiavolkova/msh-image-optimizer-standalone/msh-image-optimizer/assets/js/image-optimizer-modern.js" \
   "/Users/anastasiavolkova/Local Sites/thedot-optimizer-test/app/public/wp-content/plugins/msh-image-optimizer/assets/js/"
```

### To Deploy All Changes to Test Site

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: The test site loads plugin code from:
```
/Users/anastasiavolkova/Local Sites/thedot-optimizer-test/app/public/wp-content/plugins/msh-image-optimizer/
```

Changes made in the standalone repo are **NOT visible** until copied to the test site!

**Pre-Deployment Checklist:**
1. Close any running PHP watchers that might overwrite files
2. Note the current file timestamps for verification later

**RECOMMENDED: Use rsync (preserves structure, handles deletions)**
```bash
rsync -av --delete \
  /Users/anastasiavolkova/msh-image-optimizer-standalone/msh-image-optimizer/ \
  "/Users/anastasiavolkova/Local Sites/thedot-optimizer-test/app/public/wp-content/plugins/msh-image-optimizer/"
```

**WORKFLOW FOR NEXT AI:**
```
1. Edit code in standalone repo
2. Run rsync command above (or cp commands below)
3. Run: wp transient delete --all
4. Tell user: "Changes deployed! Please hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)"
5. Test the change with user
```

**Alternative: Individual file deployment** (what we used this session)
```bash
# Deploy PHP files
cp "/Users/anastasiavolkova/msh-image-optimizer-standalone/msh-image-optimizer/includes/class-msh-image-optimizer.php" \
   "/Users/anastasiavolkova/Local Sites/thedot-optimizer-test/app/public/wp-content/plugins/msh-image-optimizer/includes/"

cp "/Users/anastasiavolkova/msh-image-optimizer-standalone/msh-image-optimizer/includes/class-msh-openai-connector.php" \
   "/Users/anastasiavolkova/Local Sites/thedot-optimizer-test/app/public/wp-content/plugins/msh-image-optimizer/includes/"

# Deploy JavaScript
cp "/Users/anastasiavolkova/msh-image-optimizer-standalone/msh-image-optimizer/assets/js/image-optimizer-modern.js" \
   "/Users/anastasiavolkova/Local Sites/thedot-optimizer-test/app/public/wp-content/plugins/msh-image-optimizer/assets/js/"
```

**Last Resort: Finder (less ideal)**
1. Delete `/Users/anastasiavolkova/Local Sites/thedot-optimizer-test/app/public/wp-content/plugins/msh-image-optimizer/`
2. Drag-copy `msh-image-optimizer` directory from standalone repo into `wp-content/plugins/`

### After Deployment - Clear Caches

**1. Restart Local site OR flush object/page cache:**
- In Local app: Stop and restart the site
- OR if using a cache plugin: flush its cache

**2. Clear WordPress transient cache:**
```bash
cd "/Users/anastasiavolkova/Local Sites/thedot-optimizer-test/app/public"
/Applications/Local.app/Contents/Resources/extraResources/bin/wp-cli/posix/wp transient delete --all
```

**3. Clear browser cache:**
- Hard refresh: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)
- Or open DevTools → Network → Disable cache

### Verify Deployment Succeeded

**1. Check plugin file timestamp:**
- Go to WP Admin → Plugins → Installed Plugins
- Hover over "MSH Image Optimizer"
- OR view in plugin file editor
- Confirm timestamp matches when you deployed

**2. Verify JavaScript loaded:**
- Open optimizer dashboard
- Open DevTools → Network tab
- Look for `image-optimizer-modern.js`
- Check response headers show new timestamp
- OR DevTools → Sources → search for `formatAiCreditsValue` function (should exist if new code loaded)

**3. Test AI regeneration:**
- Open AI Regeneration modal
- If BYOK configured: Should show "Unlimited" credits with no warning banner
- Start a small test (1-2 images)
- Console should show updated behavior (credits updating, etc.)

**4. Optional - Verify via WP-CLI:**
```bash
cd "/Users/anastasiavolkova/Local Sites/thedot-optimizer-test/app/public"
/Applications/Local.app/Contents/Resources/extraResources/bin/wp-cli/posix/wp plugin list | grep msh-image-optimizer
```

**⚠️ If changes still not visible:**
- Check you deployed to correct path (Local Sites/thedot-optimizer-test, NOT standalone repo)
- Verify rsync/cp command completed without errors
- Check file permissions (should be readable by web server)
- Look for PHP errors in WordPress debug log
- Confirm no other plugin/theme loading an older version of the files

### Common Deployment Issues

**Issue**: "Insufficient Credits" error still appearing
**Cause**: Old JavaScript file cached
**Fix**: Hard refresh browser or bump script version in `admin/image-optimizer-admin.php:226`

**Issue**: AI not running (instant completion)
**Cause**: Transient cache not cleared
**Fix**: Run `wp transient delete --all` command

**Issue**: Credits not deducting
**Cause**: Missing platform API key in bundled mode
**Fix**: Verify `class-msh-openai-connector.php` lines 50-53 have platform key fallback

## Questions for Reviewing AI

1. **Optimize Filtering**: Why are images with `msh_optimized_date` excluded from optimization even when they have new AI metadata? Should there be a flag like `has_pending_ai_metadata` to override this?

2. **Workflow Design**: Is the intended workflow:
   - Run AI Regeneration → generates metadata previews
   - User reviews previews
   - User clicks Optimize → applies metadata to database?

   Or should AI Regeneration automatically apply metadata?

3. **Optimization Status**: What is the difference between:
   - `msh_optimized_date` (timestamp when last optimized)
   - `optimization_status` (field that determines if image needs optimization)
   - Having AI metadata in preview vs applied to database

4. **Batch Processing**: Should there be a separate "Apply AI Metadata" button vs "Optimize Images" (WebP/compression)?

5. **UI/UX**: The grey "OPTIMIZE" button per row suggests images don't need optimization, but they DO have new AI metadata waiting. Should the button state change when new AI metadata is available?

## Next Steps Recommendation

1. **Immediate**: Debug why optimize button filters out 33 images when all are selected
2. **Trace**: Add logging to optimization filtering logic to see why images are excluded
3. **Consider**: Separate "Apply AI Metadata" workflow from "Optimize Images" (WebP/compression)
4. **Test**: After fix, verify all 35 images can have AI metadata applied to database
5. **Verify**: Old HVAC titles get replaced with new AI titles

## Additional Context

- User has been testing with various business contexts (HVAC, wellness, travel photography)
- Site has legacy images with old metadata from different business contexts
- Some filenames are corrupted (e.g., `foggy-rural-landscape-foggy-rural-landscape-windmill-toronto-ontario-toronto-ontario.jpg`)
- Two images (967, 767) have "Original file missing" errors
- Analysis cache needs to be cleared between test runs (`wp transient delete msh_analysis_cache_v2_*`)

## Success Criteria for Complete Fix

- [ ] All 35 images can be selected and optimized in one batch
- [ ] AI-generated metadata gets applied to database (updates post_title, alt_text, etc.)
- [ ] Old HVAC/incorrect titles get replaced with new AI-generated titles
- [ ] Filename suggestions can be applied (separate from metadata optimization)
- [ ] Credit balance updates correctly after each operation
- [ ] No cached data interferes with fresh AI generation
