# Debug Logger - Quick Start Guide

## üöÄ Get Started in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Enable Logging (30 seconds)

Open `wp-config.php` and add this line:

```php
define('MSH_DEBUG_LOGGING', true);
```

**That's it!** Logging is now active.

---

### Step 2: Run Your Tests (2 minutes)

1. Go to **WP Admin ‚Üí Media ‚Üí Image Optimizer**
2. Click **"Run Analyzer"**
3. Watch the analyzer process all images
4. All activity is being logged in real-time

---

### Step 3: View the Logs (1 minute)

```bash
# Navigate to log directory
cd wp-content/uploads/msh-debug-logs/

# View the latest log file
ls -lht | head -1
# Shows: msh-debug-2025-10-14-abc123de.log

# Read the log
cat msh-debug-2025-10-14-abc123de.log
```

## üìä What You'll See

### Sample Log Output:

  method: direct
  mismatch: NO

[14:23:46.123] [FILE_RESOLVER] MISMATCH RESOLVED: Attachment 611 - Expected "workspace-facility-austin-equipment-austin-texas-611-equipment-austin-texas-611-equipment-austin-texas-611.jpg" ‚Üí Found "workspace-facility-austin-equipment-austin-texas-611.jpg"

## üîç Quick Analysis Commands

### Find All Mismatches

```bash
grep "MISMATCH RESOLVED" wp-content/uploads/msh-debug-logs/*.log
```

**Shows:** All attachments where file resolver used fallback to find files

### Count Resolver Operations

```bash
grep -c "FILE_RESOLVER" wp-content/uploads/msh-debug-logs/msh-debug-2025-10-14-*.log
```

**Shows:** How many file resolution attempts were made

### Find Errors

```bash
grep "‚ùå" wp-content/uploads/msh-debug-logs/*.log
```

**Shows:** Any errors that occurred during operations

### Check Specific Attachment

```bash
grep "Attachment 611" wp-content/uploads/msh-debug-logs/*.log
```

**Shows:** All log entries for a specific attachment ID

## üéØ What Gets Logged

| Operation | What You See |
|-----------|--------------|
| **File Resolver** | ‚Ä¢ Direct path matches<br>‚Ä¢ Fallback pattern resolutions<br>‚Ä¢ Mismatch details<br>‚Ä¢ Method used (direct/fallback) |
| **Analyzer** | ‚Ä¢ Which attachments analyzed<br>‚Ä¢ Success/failure status<br>‚Ä¢ File paths and sizes<br>‚Ä¢ Context details |
| **Rename** | ‚Ä¢ Old ‚Üí New filenames<br>‚Ä¢ Verification results<br>‚Ä¢ Success/failure status |
| **Errors** | ‚Ä¢ What went wrong<br>‚Ä¢ Stack context<br>‚Ä¢ Attachment IDs affected |

## üí° Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Check File Resolver Performance

**Goal:** See how many attachments have path mismatches

```bash
# Enable logging
echo "define('MSH_DEBUG_LOGGING', true);" >> wp-config.php

# Run analyzer in WP Admin
# Then check results:

grep "FILE_RESOLVER" wp-content/uploads/msh-debug-logs/*.log | wc -l
# Shows: Total resolver calls

grep "MISMATCH RESOLVED" wp-content/uploads/msh-debug-logs/*.log | wc -l
# Shows: How many needed fallback
```

### Test 2: Monitor Specific Operation

**Goal:** Track analyzer run from start to finish

```bash
# Start logging
tail -f wp-content/uploads/msh-debug-logs/msh-debug-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-*.log

# In another terminal, trigger analyzer
# Watch live log output
```

### Test 3: Verify Clean Import

**Goal:** Confirm fresh test data has no mismatches

```bash
# After importing WordPress theme test data
# Run analyzer, then check:

grep "mismatch: YES" wp-content/uploads/msh-debug-logs/msh-debug-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-*.log

# Should return nothing (no mismatches)
```

---

## üßπ Cleanup

### Disable Logging

```php
// Remove or comment out in wp-config.php:
// define('MSH_DEBUG_LOGGING', true);
```

### Delete Old Logs

```bash
# Delete logs older than 7 days (automatic)
# Or manually:
rm wp-content/uploads/msh-debug-logs/msh-debug-2025-10-13-*.log
```

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "No log files created?"

**Check 1:** Is logging enabled?
```bash
grep "MSH_DEBUG_LOGGING" wp-config.php
# Should show: define('MSH_DEBUG_LOGGING', true);
```

**Check 2:** Directory permissions
```bash
ls -la wp-content/uploads/ | grep msh-debug-logs
# Should show: drwxr-xr-x ... msh-debug-logs

# If missing or wrong permissions:
mkdir -p wp-content/uploads/msh-debug-logs
chmod 755 wp-content/uploads/msh-debug-logs
```

**Check 3:** Run a test operation
- Go to WP Admin
- Click "Run Analyzer"
- Check for new log file

### "Log file too large?"

Clear the current log:
```bash
> wp-content/uploads/msh-debug-logs/msh-debug-2025-10-14-abc123de.log
```

Or filter to specific context:
```bash
grep "FILE_RESOLVER" large-log.log > resolver-only.log
```

## üéì Example Session

```bash
# 1. Enable
define('MSH_DEBUG_LOGGING', true);

# 2. Test
# Run analyzer in WP Admin

# 3. Review
cd wp-content/uploads/msh-debug-logs
cat msh-debug-2025-10-14-abc123de.log

# 4. Analyze
grep "MISMATCH" msh-debug-2025-10-14-abc123de.log
# Result: Shows which attachments had path mismatches

# 5. Verify fix
grep "method: fallback" msh-debug-2025-10-14-abc123de.log | wc -l
# Result: Count of successful fallback resolutions

# 6. Disable
# Remove MSH_DEBUG_LOGGING from wp-config.php
```

---

## ‚úÖ Expected Results (Fresh Test Data)

With clean WordPress theme test data (no mismatches):

```
[14:23:46.001] [FILE_RESOLVER] Direct match: Attachment 1692 - spectacles.gif
[14:23:46.045] [FILE_RESOLVER] Direct match: Attachment 1691 - dsc20050315_145007_132.jpg
[14:23:46.089] [FILE_RESOLVER] Direct match: Attachment 1690 - 2014-slider-mobile-behavior.mov
... (all should be "Direct match")
```

**Zero "MISMATCH RESOLVED" entries** = Everything working correctly!
