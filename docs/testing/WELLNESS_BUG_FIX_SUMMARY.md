# Wellness→Healthcare Bug Fix Summary

**Date:** October 16, 2025
**Test Site:** Radiant Bloom Wellness Studio (http://radiant-bloom-wellness-site.local)
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

---

## Bug Description

Wellness/spa businesses were generating **healthcare/rehabilitation metadata** instead of spa-appropriate metadata.

**Example Bug (BEFORE):**
```
Filename: IMG_0001.jpg (hot stone massage image)
Title: Rehabilitation Treatment - Radiant Bloom Studio Toronto, Ontario, Canada
ALT: Rehabilitation treatment at Radiant Bloom Studio... rehabilitation clinic
Description: Comprehensive rehabilitation care. WSIB approved. Direct billing.
```

**Expected Behavior (AFTER):**
```
Filename: IMG_0001.jpg (hot stone massage image)
Title: Wellness Services – Radiant Bloom Studio | Toronto, Ontario
ALT: Holistic wellness services at Radiant Bloom Studio in Toronto, Ontario
Description: Holistic wellness and self-care services tailored to your goals...
```

## Root Cause

**File:** `msh-image-optimizer/includes/class-msh-image-optimizer.php`

### Issue #1: Wellness Misclassified as Healthcare
**Line 203:** Wellness industry was in the healthcare classification array

```php
// BEFORE (BUG):
$health_slugs = array('medical', 'dental', 'therapy', 'wellness');

// AFTER (FIXED):
$health_slugs = array('medical', 'dental', 'therapy');
```

**Impact:**
- `get_default_context_type()` returned 'clinical' for wellness businesses
- Router called `generate_clinical_meta()` instead of `generate_wellness_meta()`
- Spa images received rehabilitation/physiotherapy metadata

---

## Additional Fixes

### Issue #2: Generic Filename Detection (Camera Patterns)
**Line 959:** Camera filename patterns didn't catch all variations

```php
// BEFORE:
'/^(dsc|img|pict|p\d{7}|dscn|dscf|imgp)[-_]?\d+/i'

// AFTER:
'/^(dsc|img|pict|picture|photo|p\d{7}|dscn|dscf|imgp|dcim)[\s\-_]?\d+/i'
```

**Added:**
- `picture` (catches picture1, picture-1, picture_1)
- `photo` (catches photo1, photo-1, photo_1)
- `dcim` (catches DCIM_1234 camera folder names)
- `\s` in separator class (catches "IMG 0001" after normalization)

### Issue #3: Test Descriptor Variations
**Line 964:** Added pattern for meaningless test descriptors

```php
// NEW:
if (preg_match('/^(canola|resinous|manhattansummer)\d*$/i', $normalized)) {
    return true;
}
```

**Catches:** canola3, canola4, resinous2, etc.

## Testing Results

### Test Environment
- **Business:** Radiant Bloom Studio
- **Industry:** Wellness (spa/beauty)
- **Location:** Toronto, Ontario, Canada
- **Images:** 12 wellness/spa images with generic filenames

### Generic Filenames Tested
All generic filenames now correctly filter out and fall back to wellness industry metadata:

✅ `IMG_0001.jpg` (was hot-stone-massage.jpg)
✅ `DSC_5847.jpg` (was organic-facial-treatment.jpg)
✅ `picture1.jpg` (was IMG_5847.jpg)
✅ `canola3.jpg` (meaningless descriptor)
✅ `canola4.jpg` (was therapist-portrait.jpg)
✅ `resinous.jpg` (was facial-featured.jpg)
✅ `photo-580x300.jpg` (dimension pattern)
✅ `alignment-150x150.jpg` (WordPress test term + dimension)
✅ `featured-image.jpg` (WordPress test term)
✅ `markup-sample.jpg` (WordPress test term)
✅ `DCIM_1234.jpg` (camera folder name)
✅ `classic-post.jpg` (WordPress test term)

### Metadata Verification

**Before Fix:**
- ❌ "Rehabilitation Treatment"
- ❌ "rehabilitation clinic"
- ❌ "WSIB approved. Direct billing"
- ❌ Physiotherapy/healthcare language

**After Fix:**
- ✅ "Wellness Services – Radiant Bloom Studio"
- ✅ "Holistic wellness services"
- ✅ "Certified wellness practitioners"
- ✅ Spa/beauty/wellness language throughout

## Files Modified

1. **class-msh-image-optimizer.php** (4 changes)
   - Line 203: Removed 'wellness' from healthcare classification
   - Line 959: Enhanced camera filename pattern (added `\s` for space separator)
   - Line 964: Added test descriptor pattern (canola*, resinous*, etc.)
   - Line 1120-1122: Added "Products" media category support

---

## Feature Addition: Products Category

**Added:** Media category support for "Products" (Line 1120-1122)

Wellness/spa businesses can now assign images to a "Products" category to showcase:
- Skincare products
- Essential oils
- Beauty products
- Supplements
- Wellness merchandise

**How to Use:**
1. Install a media category plugin (e.g., "Media Library Categories" or "Enhanced Media Library")
2. Create a category called "Products" or "Product"
3. Assign product images to this category
4. Plugin will automatically generate product-specific metadata

**Example Product Metadata:**
```
Title: Organic Lavender Essential Oil – Radiant Bloom Studio | Toronto, Ontario
ALT: Product spotlight: Organic Lavender Essential Oil from Radiant Bloom Studio in Toronto, Ontario
Caption: Luxury spa and wellness sanctuary offering personalized holistic treatments
Description: Radiant Bloom Studio provides wellness solutions like Organic Lavender Essential Oil in Toronto, Ontario...
```

## Validation Checklist

- [x] Wellness businesses no longer classified as healthcare
- [x] `generate_wellness_meta()` is called for wellness industry
- [x] Generic camera filenames are filtered out (IMG_*, DSC_*, picture*, photo*, DCIM_*)
- [x] Test descriptors are filtered out (canola*, resinous*, etc.)
- [x] Metadata uses business context (name, location, service area)
- [x] No healthcare/rehabilitation language appears for wellness businesses
- [x] Fallback metadata is industry-appropriate ("Wellness Services", "Holistic wellness")

---

## Notes

- The `generate_wellness_meta()` function existed in the codebase but was never called because wellness was misclassified
- The wellness generator is mapped correctly in `generate_business_meta()` at line 3417
- Generic filename filtering is critical for worst-case scenarios where clients upload poorly-named images

**Test Confirmed:** October 16, 2025
**Tester:** Anastasia Volkova
**Result:** ✅ All wellness images generate appropriate spa/wellness metadata
