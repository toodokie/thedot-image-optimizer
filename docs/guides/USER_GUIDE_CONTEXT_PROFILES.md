## What are Context Profiles?

**Context Profiles** let you manage multiple brand identities, locations, or audience segments within a single WordPress site.

### The Problem They Solve

Imagine you have:
- A main business in New York
- A branch office in Los Angeles
- Spanish-language landing pages
- Different product lines with unique branding

**Without profiles:** All images get the same generic metadata
**With profiles:** Each context gets customized, relevant metadata

### How They Work

Think of profiles as "presets" for your business context:

```
Primary Profile (Default)
├── Business: Main Street Dental
├── Location: New York, NY
├── Audience: Local patients
└── Language: English

Spanish Landing Pages Profile
├── Business: Main Street Dental
├── Location: New York, NY
├── Audience: Spanish-speaking patients
└── Language: Spanish (es_ES)

LA Branch Profile
├── Business: Main Street Dental LA
├── Location: Los Angeles, CA
├── Audience: LA-area patients
└── Language: English
```

When you generate AI metadata, it uses the **active profile** to create contextually relevant descriptions.

---

## When to Use Profiles

### ✅ You SHOULD Use Profiles If:

**Multi-Location Business**
- Restaurants with multiple locations
- Service areas in different cities
- Franchise operations
- Regional offices

**Multilingual Content**
- Spanish landing pages on English site
- French-Canadian content alongside English
- International markets

**Different Product Lines**
- B2B and B2C offerings
- Multiple brands under one company
- Different service tiers (basic/premium)

**Varied Audiences**
- Targeting different demographics

### ❌ You DON'T Need Profiles If:

**Use Case:** Just use the Primary profile and you're all set!

## Best Practices

### Profile Naming

**✅ Good Names:**

- "Summer 2025 Campaign" (clear timeframe)

**❌ Bad Names:**
- "Profile 1" (not descriptive)
- "Test" (not meaningful)
- "asdf" (unprofessional)

### Organization

**Start Simple:**
1. Use Primary profile for main content
2. Add profiles only when needed
3. Don't over-complicate

**Common Structure:**
```
Primary (Default)
├── Main business, primary location
│
Regional Profiles
├── LA Branch
├── Miami Branch
│
Language Profiles
├── Spanish Content
├── French Content
│
Seasonal/Campaign Profiles
└── Holiday 2025
```

### Maintenance

**Regular Review:**
- Quarterly: Check if profiles still needed
- Delete inactive profiles
- Update context as business changes

**Consistent Updates:**
- When you change primary, update profiles too
- Keep business details synchronized
- Update locale codes if site language changes

**A:** Unlimited! Create as many as you need. However, we recommend keeping it manageable (5-10 max) for ease of use.

**A:** No! Existing metadata stays unchanged until you actively regenerate it with a profile active.

---

### Q: Can I delete a profile?

**A:** Yes! Click the trash icon next to the profile. If it's the active profile, the system automatically switches to Primary.

---

### Q: What happens if I delete the Primary profile?

**A:** You can't delete Primary - it's required. You can edit it, but not delete it.

---

### Q: Do I need to rebuild the index when switching profiles?

---

### Q: Can profiles have different API keys?

### Q: Do I need profiles for WPML/Polylang multilingual sites?
