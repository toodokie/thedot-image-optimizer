## Testing Philosophy

### Multi-Industry Validation

MSH Image Optimizer supports **17 different industries**, each with unique:
- Vocabulary and terminology
- Professional designations
- Service offerings
- Target audiences
- Business contexts

**Testing Strategy:** Create dedicated test sites for representative industries across three major categories:

1. **Healthcare & Wellness** (4 industries: medical, dental, therapy, wellness)
2. **Home Services** (4 industries: plumbing, HVAC, electrical, renovation)
3. **Professional Services** (9 industries: legal, accounting, consulting, marketing, web_design, real_estate, financial, insurance, photography)

## Test Site Matrix

## Testing Methodology

### For Each Test Site:

**1. Site Setup** (20-30 minutes)
- Create Local by Flywheel site
- Install MSH Image Optimizer plugin
- Configure industry-specific business context
- Create sample pages with industry-appropriate copy

**2. Image Preparation** (10-15 minutes)
- Download 12-18 stock images appropriate for industry
- Rename to test edge cases:
  - Generic camera filenames (`IMG_5847.jpg`)
  - Dimension patterns (`photo-580x300.jpg`)
  - WordPress test terms (`alignment-image.jpg`, `featured-photo.jpg`)
  - Meaningless descriptors (`canola2.jpg`, `sample.jpg`)
  - Specific descriptors to preserve (`margaret-sterling.jpg`)

**3. Upload & Initial Review** (5 minutes)
- Upload all images to WordPress Media Library
- Let plugin auto-generate metadata
- Review for obvious issues

**4. Validation Checklist** (10-15 minutes)
- [ ] Industry-specific vocabulary appears
- [ ] Professional designation correct for industry
- [ ] Service area mentioned appropriately
- [ ] UVP incorporated where relevant
- [ ] Business name and location present
- [ ] Dimension patterns filtered out
- [ ] WordPress test terms removed
- [ ] Generic descriptors handled appropriately
- [ ] Specific descriptors preserved
- [ ] NO cross-industry contamination (e.g., spa getting healthcare terms)

**5. Edge Case Testing** (10 minutes)
- Test with different image types (team, facility, service, products)
- Verify fallback behavior for images with no context
- Test descriptor extraction from various filename patterns
- Validate cascading fallback (UVP ‚Üí Pain Points ‚Üí Target Audience ‚Üí Generic)

### Before Major Releases:

1. **Full test suite** across all priority test sites
2. **New image uploads** to each test site (simulate fresh use)
