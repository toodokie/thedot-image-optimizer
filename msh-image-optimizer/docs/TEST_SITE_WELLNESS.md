## Step 5: Download Wellness/Spa Stock Images (10 minutes)

### Free Stock Photo Sources

**Unsplash Collections:**
1. Go to: https://unsplash.com/s/photos/spa-treatment
2. Go to: https://unsplash.com/s/photos/massage-therapy
3. Go to: https://unsplash.com/s/photos/facial-treatment
4. Go to: https://unsplash.com/s/photos/wellness-center

**Pexels Collections:**
1. Go to: https://www.pexels.com/search/spa/
2. Go to: https://www.pexels.com/search/massage/
3. Go to: https://www.pexels.com/search/beauty%20treatment/

### Recommended Image Types (Download 12-15 total):

**Treatment Room Images (3-4):**
- Spa treatment room with massage table
- Facial treatment room
- Relaxation area with candles
- Reception area

**Service Images (4-5):**
- Massage therapy session
- Facial treatment in progress
- Body treatment/wrap
- Hot stone massage

**Team/Staff Images (2-3):**
- Spa therapist portrait
- Team photo
- Aesthetician at work

**Product/Detail Images (2-3):**
- Organic skincare products
- Essential oils and aromatherapy
- Spa tools and equipment
- Natural beauty ingredients

**Facility Images (1-2):**
- Spa exterior or entrance
- Wellness center interior

### Image Naming Convention (Before Upload):

Rename downloaded images to generic test names to simulate real-world scenarios:
- `IMG_5847.jpg` (camera filename)
- `treatment-room.jpg` (generic)
- `spa-photo.jpg` (generic)
- `massage-1.jpg` (generic)
- `facial-580x300.jpg` (dimension pattern)
- `wellness-alignment.jpg` (WordPress test term)
- `therapist.jpg` (generic)
- `products.jpg` (generic)
- `canola3.jpg` (meaningless like canola2)
- `markup-image.jpg` (WordPress test term)
- `featured-spa.jpg` (WordPress test term)
- `sample-wellness.jpg` (generic term)

**Why?** This tests the sanitization and metadata generation with real-world generic/poor filenames.

---

## Step 6: Upload Images to WordPress (5 minutes)

### Upload via WordPress Admin:

1. Go to: http://radiant-bloom-wellness.local/wp-admin
2. Media â†’ Add New
3. Drag and drop all 12-15 images
4. Wait for upload to complete
5. **DO NOT manually edit metadata** - let the plugin generate it

### Review Generated Metadata:

1. Click on each uploaded image in Media Library
2. Check the **Meta Preview** section
3. Look for:
   - **Title:** Should mention spa/wellness/beauty (NOT "Rehabilitation Treatment")
   - **ALT Text:** Should describe wellness service
   - **Caption:** Should mention spa therapists/aestheticians (NOT "Licensed physiotherapist")
   - **Description:** Should mention wellness/spa services (NOT "WSIB approved" or rehabilitation)

---

## Step 7: Expected Results (BEFORE Bug Fix)

### ðŸ”¥ **BUG:** Wellness Will Generate Healthcare Metadata

**Expected (Current Broken Behavior):**
```
Title: Rehabilitation Treatment - Radiant Bloom Studio Toronto, Ontario
ALT: Rehabilitation treatment at Radiant Bloom Studio Toronto, Ontario rehabilitation clinic
Caption: Licensed physiotherapist team
Description: Comprehensive rehabilitation care tailored to patient recovery.
            Return-to-work programs. WSIB approved. Direct billing.
```

**This is WRONG for a spa/beauty salon!**

---

## Step 8: Expected Results (AFTER Bug Fix)

### âœ… **FIXED:** Wellness Will Generate Spa/Beauty Metadata

**Expected (After Implementing Fixes):**
```
Title: Spa Treatment - Radiant Bloom Studio | Toronto, Ontario
ALT: Spa treatment at Radiant Bloom Studio in Toronto, Ontario
Caption: Certified wellness therapists
Description: Luxury spa and wellness sanctuary offering personalized holistic
            treatments, organic skincare, and rejuvenating massage therapy
            in a tranquil urban oasis. Certified aestheticians and massage
            therapists serving Greater Toronto Area.
```

**This is CORRECT for a spa/beauty salon!**

---

## Troubleshooting

### If Plugin Doesn't Generate Metadata:

**Check plugin is active:**
```bash
cd "/Users/anastasiavolkova/Local Sites/radiant-bloom-wellness/app/public"
/Applications/Local.app/Contents/Resources/extraResources/bin/wp-cli/posix/wp plugin list
```

**Activate if needed:**
```bash
/Applications/Local.app/Contents/Resources/extraResources/bin/wp-cli/posix/wp plugin activate msh-image-optimizer
```

### If Context Isn't Loading:

**Check option exists:**
```bash
/Applications/Local.app/Contents/Resources/extraResources/bin/wp-cli/posix/wp option get msh_onboarding_context
```

**Delete and recreate if needed:**
```bash
/Applications/Local.app/Contents/Resources/extraResources/bin/wp-cli/posix/wp option delete msh_onboarding_context
# Then re-run the update command from Step 3
```

### If You See Errors in Media Library:

Check PHP error log:
```bash
tail -f "/Users/anastasiavolkova/Local Sites/radiant-bloom-wellness/app/public/wp-content/debug.log"
```

## Testing Checklist

After upload, verify:

- [ ] All images uploaded successfully (12-15 images)
- [ ] Plugin generated metadata automatically
- [ ] **BUG CHECK:** Does wellness get "Rehabilitation" metadata? (It will before fix)
- [ ] Filenames were cleaned (dimension patterns, WordPress terms)
- [ ] Descriptors were extracted from generic names
- [ ] Business name appears in metadata
- [ ] Location appears in metadata
- [ ] Industry-specific language appears (spa/wellness vs. rehabilitation)

---

## What's Next

After confirming the bug exists on this fresh wellness site:

1. **Fix 1:** Remove 'wellness' from healthcare industry list
2. **Fix 2:** Implement `generate_wellness_meta()` function
3. **Fix 3:** Add wellness to industry routing in `generate_business_meta()`
4. **Fix 4:** Fix default case to not fall through to `generate_clinical_meta()`

Then re-upload images and verify spa/beauty metadata appears instead of rehabilitation metadata.
