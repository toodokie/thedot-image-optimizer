## Database Schema (New Options)

The code creates/uses these WordPress options:

### Credit System
- `msh_ai_credit_balance` - Current available credits (int)
- `msh_ai_credit_last_reset` - Timestamp of last monthly reset
- `msh_ai_credit_usage` - Monthly usage tracking (array, 12 months)

### Bulk Regeneration
- `msh_metadata_regen_queue_state` - Current queue state
- `msh_metadata_regen_jobs` - Job history (max 10 archived)

### AI Configuration (existing)
- `msh_ai_features` - Enabled AI features array
- `msh_ai_api_key` - BYOK API key
- `msh_ai_mode` - manual|assist|hybrid
- `msh_plan_tier` - free|ai_starter|ai_pro|ai_business

## WP-Cron Scheduled Events

### New Cron Hook
- **Event:** `msh_ai_refresh_credits`
- **Recurrence:** Monthly (first day of month, midnight)
- **Action:** Resets credit balance based on plan tier
- **Registered in:** `MSH_AI_Service::__construct()`

## Credit Flow - How It Works

### Single Image (Upload/Manual)
```php
1. Image uploaded
2. generate_meta_fields() called
3. → maybe_generate_metadata()
4.   → determine_access_state()
5.     → Check credits_remaining
6.     → If 0: return ['allowed' => false, 'reason' => 'insufficient_credits']
7.   → If allowed: apply_filters('msh_ai_generate_metadata')
8.     → OpenAI connector generates metadata
9.   → Decrement 1 credit (if bundled)
10.  → Return metadata
```

### Bulk Job
```php
1. User queues job
2. → estimate_bulk_job_cost($ids)
3.   → Get current credits_remaining
4.   → If count($ids) > credits_remaining: return WP_Error
5. → Create job + queue state
6. → Schedule WP-Cron
7. Process batch (25 images):
8.   foreach ($batch as $id) {
9.     → SAME flow as single image above
10.    → Each successful AI call decrements 1 credit
11.  }
12. → Check if credits exhausted
13.   → If yes: pause job
14. → Schedule next batch or complete
```

### Monthly Reset
```php
1. WP-Cron triggers 'msh_ai_refresh_credits'
2. → MSH_AI_Service::refresh_monthly_credits()
3.   → Read current plan tier
4.   → Set balance = PLAN_CREDITS[plan_tier]
5.   → Update last_reset timestamp
6.   → Log to error_log
```

## Credit Plan Mappings

```php
const PLAN_CREDITS = [
    'free' => 0,          // No AI access
    'ai_starter' => 100,  // 100 credits/month
    'ai_pro' => 500,      // 500 credits/month
    'ai_business' => 2000, // 2000 credits/month
];
```

**BYOK:** Unlimited (`PHP_INT_MAX`)

## Testing Checklist for Other AI

### 1. Credit Initialization
```bash
# Set plan tier
wp option update msh_plan_tier ai_starter

# Delete existing balance to trigger initialization
wp option delete msh_ai_credit_balance

# Upload an image (triggers AI) - should initialize to 100
# Check balance
wp option get msh_ai_credit_balance
# Expected: 100
```

### 2. Credit Decrement
```bash
# Check starting balance
wp option get msh_ai_credit_balance

# Upload image or regenerate metadata (AI call)
# Check balance again
wp option get msh_ai_credit_balance
# Expected: Previous - 1
```

### 3. Credit Exhaustion
```bash
# Set balance to 0
wp option update msh_ai_credit_balance 0

# Try to upload image
# Expected: Falls back to heuristic metadata (no AI)

# Check logs
tail -f /path/to/debug.log | grep "MSH AI"
# Should NOT see "AI generated metadata"
```

### 4. Monthly Reset
```bash
# Manual trigger
wp cron event run msh_ai_refresh_credits

# Check balance
wp option get msh_ai_credit_balance
# Expected: Reset to plan tier amount (e.g., 100 for ai_starter)
```

### 5. Bulk Job Estimation
```bash
# Get all image IDs
wp post list --post_type=attachment --format=ids

# Try to queue bulk job via AJAX (from browser console):
jQuery.post(ajaxurl, {
    action: 'msh_start_ai_regeneration',
    nonce: mshAdmin.nonce,
    attachment_ids: [1,2,3,4,5],
    mode: 'fill-empty',
    fields: ['title','alt_text']
}, console.log);

# Check response - should show estimate
# If credits < 5, should return error
```

### 6. BYOK Unlimited
```bash
# Set API key
wp option update msh_ai_api_key 'sk-test123...'

# Check access state - should return unlimited credits
# Upload image - should NOT decrement credits
wp option get msh_ai_credit_balance
# Balance should not change with BYOK
```

## Known Issues / Edge Cases

### ✅ Handled
- First-time initialization (null balance)
- Credit exhaustion mid-job (pauses gracefully)
- BYOK vs bundled access (separate paths)
- Monthly reset scheduling (auto-scheduled on construct)

### ⚠️ To Verify
1. **Cron scheduling:** Verify cron hook actually runs monthly
   ```bash
   wp cron event list | grep msh_ai_refresh_credits
   ```

2. **Concurrent jobs:** Background queue has lock (transient)
   - Verify only one job runs at a time

3. **Credit race condition:** Multiple simultaneous uploads
   - WordPress atomic option updates should handle this
   - But worth stress testing

4. **Plan tier changes:** What happens if user downgrades mid-month?
   - Current: Balance persists until next reset
   - Consider: Immediate adjustment?

## What's NOT Yet Implemented

### UI Components (Phase 3 - In Progress)
- Dashboard card for bulk regeneration
- Confirmation modal with credit estimate display
- Live progress widget
- Credit status widget on dashboard
- Media Library bulk action integration

### CLI Commands (Planned)
- `wp msh ai-regenerate --all`
- `wp msh ai-status`
- `wp msh ai-pause/resume/cancel`

## Files for Review Priority

**High Priority:**
1. `includes/class-msh-ai-service.php` - Credit system (verify logic)
2. `includes/class-msh-metadata-regeneration-background.php` - Queue processor

**Medium Priority:**
3. `includes/class-msh-image-optimizer.php` - AI filename integration
4. `includes/class-msh-openai-connector.php` - OpenAI API calls

**Low Priority (Docs):**
5. `BULK_REGEN_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`
6. `LIVE_LINK_SETUP_GUIDE.md`

## Questions for Other AI

1. **Credit logic:** Does the credit flow make sense? Any edge cases missed?

2. **Monthly reset:** Should we adjust balance immediately on plan change, or wait for next reset?

3. **Error handling:** Bulk job failure scenarios - anything missing?

4. **Database:** Any concerns about option bloat? Should we use custom tables instead?

5. **Security:** AJAX endpoints have nonce checks, but anything else needed?

## Next Steps

After code review:
1. ✅ Other AI pulls latest main
2. ✅ Reviews credit metering logic
3. ✅ Tests credit scenarios
4. 🔄 We continue with Phase 3 (UI) or fix any issues found
