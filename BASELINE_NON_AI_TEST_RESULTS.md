## Observations

### What Works Well ‚úÖ

1. **Camera filename detection** - `IMG_9823` correctly identified and replaced
2. **Dimension pattern stripping** - `-1200x800`, `-580x300` patterns removed
3. **Meaningless descriptor filtering** - `canola4` replaced with generic metadata
4. **Specific descriptor preservation** - `courthouse`, `law-books` kept
5. **Team photo detection** - `team` keyword triggers appropriate group metadata
6. **Location integration** - Toronto, ON consistently included
7. **Business context** - UVP and achievement markers properly used
8. **SEO-friendly filenames** - Location-based, industry-aware suggestions

### Potential Improvements ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **Capitalization** - Descriptors like "boardroom", "courthouse", "law-books" shown in lowercase in titles
   - Should be: "Boardroom ‚Äì Sterling & Associates..."
   - Currently: "boardroom ‚Äì Sterling & Associates..."

2. **Hyphenated terms** - "law-books" should display as "Law Books" (with space)
   - Should be: "Law Books ‚Äì Sterling & Associates..."
   - Currently: "law-books ‚Äì Sterling & Associates..."

3. **Generic legal terms** - "attorney", "consultation" kept as descriptors
   - Could be considered too generic and filtered out
   - OR intentionally kept as contextually relevant

4. **Duplicate filename suggestions** - `sterling-associates-law-firm-team-team.jpg` has "team" twice
   - Should be: `sterling-associates-law-firm-team.jpg`

### Critical Bugs Fixed in v1.2.0 üîß

1. ‚úÖ **Dimension pattern detection** - Fixed regex to catch `-580x300` patterns with hyphens/underscores
2. ‚úÖ **Title sanitization** - Strip dimensions from title before team/person detection
3. ‚úÖ **Team keyword false positives** - "team-580x300" no longer treated as person name
4. ‚úÖ **Slugify dimension removal** - Dimensions stripped when creating slugs
